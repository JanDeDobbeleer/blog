// Sentenses

Where reset will move the branch that HEAD points to, checkout will move HEAD itself to point to another branch
The --squash option takes all the work on the merged branch and squashes it into one non-merge commit on top of the branch you’re on.
You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).
When you have a tracking branch set up, you can reference it with the @{upstream} or @{u} shorthand. So if you’re on the master branch and it’s tracking origin/master, you can say something like git merge @{u} instead of git merge origin/master if you want.
A safer option is to run git stash --all to remove everything but save it in a stash
If you want Git to try a bit more intelligently to resolve the conflict, you can pass a -3 option to it, which makes Git attempt a three-way merge.
You can also use git apply to see if a patch applies cleanly before you try actually applying it—you can run git apply --check with the patch:

// force pushing

so make sure no commit shows up in that list that you’ve already pushed to a shared repository.
don’t amend your last commit if you’ve already pushed it.
Don’t include any commit you’ve already pushed to a central server
